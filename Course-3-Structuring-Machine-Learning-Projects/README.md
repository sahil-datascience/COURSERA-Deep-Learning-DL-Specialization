# Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects

This course teaches you how to build successful machine learning projects and become a technical leader who can ship AI products.

## 📋 Course Overview

You will learn how to diagnose errors in a machine learning system, prioritize the most promising directions for reducing error, understand complex ML settings, such as mismatched training/test sets, and comparing to and/or surpassing human-level performance.

- What is end-to-end deep learning?
- Whether to use end-to-end deep learning

**Case Study**: Autonomous Driving

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Diagnose errors in a machine learning system
- Prioritize strategies for reducing errors
- Understand and handle mismatched training and test distributions
- Compare to human-level performance and surpass it when possible
- Apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning

## 📁 Assignment Structure

This course focuses on strategy and case studies rather than programming assignments. The content includes:
- `Week-1/`: ML Strategy case studies and quizzes
- `Week-2/`: Advanced ML strategy concepts and autonomous driving case study

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Orthogonalization**: Having clear, independent knobs to tune different aspects of your system
- **Single Number Evaluation Metric**: Having one number to optimize makes decision-making easier
- **Error Analysis**: Systematically analyzing errors to prioritize improvements
- **Data Mismatch**: When training and test data come from different distributions
- **Transfer Learning**: Using knowledge from one task to improve learning on another task
- **End-to-End Learning**: Learning a mapping directly from input to output
