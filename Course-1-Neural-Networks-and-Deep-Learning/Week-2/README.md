# Week 2: Neural Networks Basics

## üìù Programming Assignment: Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset

### Overview
Implement logistic regression as a neural network to classify cat vs non-cat images.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the logistic regression algorithm
- Implement forward and backward propagation
- Learn to use numpy for efficient computation
- Build and train a complete logistic regression model

### Files
- `Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset_v6a.ipynb` - Main assignment notebook
- `datasets/` - Contains training and test datasets
- `helper_functions.py` - Utility functions for the assignment

### Key Concepts
- Sigmoid activation function
- Cost function and gradient descent
- Vectorization in Python
- Forward and backward propagation

### Assignment Tasks
1. Initialize parameters
2. Implement forward propagation (prediction)
3. Compute cost function
4. Implement backward propagation (gradients)
5. Update parameters using gradient descent
6. Integrate all functions into a model
7. Make predictions on test data

### Results
After completing this assignment, you should be able to:
- Build a logistic regression classifier
- Understand the importance of vectorization
- Achieve good accuracy on the cat classification task
