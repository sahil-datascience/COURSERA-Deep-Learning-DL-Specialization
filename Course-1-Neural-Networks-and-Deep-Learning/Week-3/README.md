# Week 3: Shallow Neural Networks

## üìù Programming Assignment: Planar Data Classification with One Hidden Layer

### Overview
Build a neural network with one hidden layer to classify data points in a plane (2D dataset).

### Learning Objectives
- Understand neural network architecture with hidden layers
- Implement forward propagation for a 2-layer neural network
- Implement backward propagation for parameter updates
- Compare performance with logistic regression

### Files
- `Planar_data_classification_with_onehidden_layer_v6c.ipynb` - Main assignment notebook
- `datasets/` - Contains the planar dataset
- `planar_utils.py` - Helper functions for visualization and data generation

### Key Concepts
- Hidden layer representation
- Multiple activation functions (tanh, sigmoid, ReLU)
- Non-linear decision boundaries
- Parameter initialization strategies

### Assignment Tasks
1. Implement forward propagation for 2-layer neural network
2. Compute the cross-entropy cost
