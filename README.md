# Coursera Deep Learning Specialization - Programming Assignments

This repository contains my programming assignments and solutions for the **Deep Learning Specialization** offered by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera. The specialization consists of 5 courses that provide a comprehensive foundation in deep learning.

## 📚 Specialization Overview

The Deep Learning Specialization teaches you the foundations of Deep Learning, helps you understand how to build neural networks, and leads you to success in your career in AI. This specialization covers:

- Neural networks and deep learning fundamentals
- Hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and optimization
- Machine learning project structuring
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Sequence models (RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sahil-datascience/COURSERA-Deep-Learning-DL-Specialization.git
   cd COURSERA-Deep-Learning-DL-Specialization
   ```

## 📝 Assignment Files

Each course directory contains:
- **Programming Assignments**: Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files)
- **Helper Files**: Utility functions and datasets
- **README.md**: Course-specific information and assignment descriptions

## ⚠️ Academic Integrity

**Important Note**: These solutions are shared for educational purposes and reference. If you're currently taking this specialization:

- Use these materials to understand concepts and verify your solutions
- **Do not copy solutions directly** - this violates Coursera's Honor Code
- Work through problems yourself first, then use this as a reference
- Understand the code rather than just copying it
